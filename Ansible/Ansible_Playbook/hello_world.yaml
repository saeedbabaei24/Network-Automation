# How ansible works? 
# It look for a file which is config file. In this file we can define where is the inventory file. 

# To see where is the config fie: 

# #ansible –version 

 

# saeed@saeed-ubuntu2:~/Desktop/Network-Automation/Ansible$ ansible --version 

# ansible [core 2.16.3] 

#   config file = /home/saeed/Desktop/Network-Automation/Ansible/ansible.cfg 

#   configured module search path = ['/home/saeed/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules'] 

#   ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ansible 

#   ansible collection location = /home/saeed/.ansible/collections:/usr/share/ansible/collections 

#   executable location = /usr/bin/ansible 

#   python version = 3.12.3 (main, Jan 22 2026, 20:57:42) [GCC 13.3.0] (/usr/bin/python3) 

#   jinja version = 3.1.2 

#   libyaml = True
